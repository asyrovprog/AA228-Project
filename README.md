# AA228 Final Project: Saving Artificial Intelligence Clinician

Project folder structure:

`results` - Summary 

`dataset_json` - Input dataset, selected sepsis patient trajectories from MIMIC dataset in json format

`dataset_artifacts*` - Different versions of processed sepsis dataset with included discrete states. Difference is in method of clustering. -vae are based on autoencoder.

`value_iterator` - implementation of model based value iterator MDP algorithm on discrete state space

'deep_sarsa' - implementation of model free SARSA algorithm with value function approximation
